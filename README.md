Knowing that alcohol, like other beverages including soft drinks, juices, tea, cocoa, and coffee, plays a significant role in many communities. Depending on how responsibly it is drunk, alcohol can have either negative or positive consequences. More research is needed to definitively determine the impact of a high per capita alcohol consumption on a nation, and these patterns are probably not reason for concern.
